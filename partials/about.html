      What is Philly GLAM HACK?
    </h2>
  </a>
   <p>
    GLAM Hack Philly is a free weekend-long hackathon focused on building apps with open data from Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums. It will take place the weekend of February 1-2, 2012 at the University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Kislak Center for Special Collections.</p>


<p>The event will bring together programmers, curators, librarians, designers, archivists and anyone else with a passion for GLAM data to build fun and interesting apps with the tremendous amount of GLAM data that is openly and freely available. On the morning of Saturday, February 1st, participants can pitch ideas for projects related to a specific data set or for broader GLAM-related applications. This could be anything from creating Omeka plug-ins to building a virtual city tour app using local digital collections. Small groups will form and participants will begin working on their projects through Sunday, with a goal to present a working prototype by Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>
We also want the event to encourage Cultural Heritage organizations to see the benefits of being active participants in the web of open data. By providing an immediate tangible benefit (the possibility of having someone build something with the data) we hope to encourage more organizations to particiapte in wider efforts like <a href="http://openglam.org">OpenGLAM</a> and <a href="http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM">GLAMWiki</a>.
